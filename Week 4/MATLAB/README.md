# Objective
The objective of the ReproRehab MATLAB curriculum is to help learners gain proficiency in creating rigorous, reproducible data analysis pipelines. To this end, learners will use a combination of video lectures, online tutorials, and hands-on activities to develop a set of analyses for an open-source data set comprised of kinematic, kinetic, and EMG data. As you work through the content, feel free to post comments and questions on ReproRehab Slack or reach out to the Teaching Assistants if you encounter any major challenges along the way.

# Introductory Material
Learners who have not been following the full ReproRehab curriculum should begin by watching the Introduction to Data Analysis video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13IuiwPAPUY). This video reviews key concepts about data and measurement and also provides a detailed description of the steps involved in a standard data analysis pipeline. 

Next, those who are new to programming or who have little programming experience should watch the Introduction to Principles of Programming video **here**. This video provides a brief overview of the most common use cases for MATLAB and then reviews key programming principles to keep in mind as you are developing your code. Most of these principles are derived from the book [MATLAB for Behavioral Scientists by Rosenbaum, Vaughan, and Wyble](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/books/matlab-for-behavioral-scientists-rosenbaum.html).

The third video in the series **here** provides a walkthrough of the MATLAB interface for those who may be new to MATLAB. If you are using MATLAB for the first time, we highly recommend completing the [MATLAB OnRamp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted) and the [Using the MATLAB Desktop](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-fundamentals/mlbe#module=2) module of MATLAB Fundamentals through Mathworks. This is an interactive, online course that introduces many of the most fundamental elements of MATLAB through a series of easy-to-follow modules. 

The remaining content will involve the analysis of [data](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4494755) from a study of walking and stair descending ([Lencioni et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0323-z)). This dataset was selected because it includes several different types of raw and processed data, and it is published as a Data Descriptor with detailed information about the study protocol, data structure, data reliability and validation, and links to the authorsâ€™ analysis code.
